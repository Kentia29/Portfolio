ABSTRACT

Depression is a mental disorder that is characterised by feelings of sadness and guilt, low self-worth, and loss of interest or pleasure. 
It affects almost four percent of the world's population. Although many factors related to depression are known, the prevalence of this 
disorder makes it necessary to extract new knowledge to generate new clinical hypotheses and to have more resources for both prevention 
and treatment if the causality is validated. In this work, self-reported health, socio-economic and lifestyle data collected in the context 
of the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative have been used to generate Machine Learning models with several classifiers (Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron). These data include depression risk factors already 
reported in the scientific literature and newly variables: life purpose, personal growth, number of psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and 
total diagnoses, and information about childhood, and social interaction. As a result, three models with similar metrics were obtained, 
with accuracies near seventy percent, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Models were also generated with these same 
classifiers for the prediction of gender-specific depression, improving the metrics of the models trained with the full dataset. As a result 
of the calculation of the Shapley values (relevance metric) of the factors, life purpose, social engagement, psychiatric diagnoses, total 
diagnoses, and the fatherâ€™s job during childhood are related to the development of depression disorder.
