## Plant disease classification

This dataset consists of about 40000 JPG images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes:
- Apple___Apple_scab
- Apple___Black_rot
- Apple___Cedar_apple_rust
- Apple___healthy
- Blueberry___healthy
- Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew
- Cherry_(including_sour)___healthy
- Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot
- Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_
- Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight
- Corn_(maize)___healthy
- Grape___Black_rot
- Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles)
- Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot)
- Grape___healthy
- Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening)
- Peach___Bacterial_spot
- Peach___healthy
- Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot
- Pepper,_bell___healthy
- Potato___Early_blight

- Potato___healthy
- Raspberry___healthy
- Soybean___healthy
- Squash___Powdery_mildew
- Strawberry___Leaf_scorch
- Strawberry___healthy
- Tomato___Bacterial_spot
- Tomato___Early_blight

A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.

This project consists in the development of a plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, using deep convolutional networks. 
The dataset used contains 38 classes that correspond to different diseases or healthy versions of 14 plant species.
