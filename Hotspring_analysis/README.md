# HOT SPRING ECOSYSTEM GENOMIC ANALYSIS

There is an interesting effect in a hot spring located in Iceland:

Coinciding with the activity of a nearby volcano, the hot spring undergoes events of very high temperature. 

After such episodes of high temperature (close to 90 degrees), a bloom of algae living in the same environment happens.

​An in depth genomic and metagenomic exploration of the hot spring ecosystem was carried out.

The project consists in the following steps:

1. Metagenomic analysis
2. Genome analysis (basic checks)
3. Genome analysis (read mapping)
4. Genome analysis (variant calling)
5. Differential expression analysis
6. Functional analysis
7. Phylogenetic analysis
8. Conclusions

All the explanaitions and the bash code are located in the hotspring_analysis.md file. The files needed to start the project are located in the sequencing_files folder.

The files generated during the different steps of the analysis can be found in the folders corresponding to each section.
